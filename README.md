# StrftimeAPI

A lightweight containerized web service that returns the current time formatted according to the strftime pattern specified in the URL path.

## Overview

StrftimeAPI is a simple yet powerful Flask-based API that allows users to obtain the current time formatted according to their needs. Simply make a request to the server with a path containing an [strftime format string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes), and the server will respond with the current time formatted accordingly.

## Features

- Request the current time in any strftime format via URL path
- Containerized for easy deployment
- Simple REST API interface
- Basic security measures to prevent injection attacks
- Helpful home page with examples

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StrftimeAPI.git
   cd StrftimeAPI
   ```

2. Build the Docker image
   ```bash
   docker build -t strftimeapi .
   ```

3. Run the container
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 strftimeapi
   ```

4. The service is now available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Make a GET request to the server with a path containing an strftime format string:

```
http://localhost:5000/%Y-%m-%d
```

This will return the current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, for example:
```
2025-04-08
```

### Examples

| URL | Result (example) | Description |
|-----|------------------|-------------|
| `/%Y-%m-%d` | `2025-04-08` | Date in YYYY-MM-DD format |
| `/%H:%M:%S` | `14:32:17` | Time in HH:MM:SS format |
| `/%A, %B %d, %Y` | `Tuesday, April 08, 2025` | Weekday, month name, day, and year |
| `/%Y%m%d-%H%M%S` | `20250408-143217` | Timestamp format |
| `/%I:%M %p` | `02:32 PM` | 12-hour clock with AM/PM |

### Format Codes

Here are some common format codes:

| Code | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `%Y` | Year with century | `2025` |
| `%m` | Month as zero-padded decimal | `04` |
| `%d` | Day of the month as zero-padded decimal | `08` |
| `%H` | Hour (24-hour clock) as zero-padded decimal | `14` |
| `%I` | Hour (12-hour clock) as zero-padded decimal | `02` |
| `%M` | Minute as zero-padded decimal | `32` |
| `%S` | Second as zero-padded decimal | `17` |
| `%p` | AM or PM | `PM` |
| `%A` | Weekday as full name | `Tuesday` |
| `%B` | Month as full name | `April` |

For a complete list of format codes, refer to the [Python datetime documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes).
